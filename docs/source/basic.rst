Basic Usage
===========

.. todo::
    Describe basic usage - basic view and wizards.

For first-time users and those who don't really want to think too much about it.
Follow each wizard's instructions in the app to fully build an installer.
Remember than you can only save or open a new installer when on the very first page!
If you're mid-way through your work but you want to save and leave, simply hit ``Finish`` until you reach that first page.

Basic View
++++++++++

.. todo::
    Describe basic view here - pretty much just the initial page.

Wizards
+++++++

This section contains the descriptions of all the wizards so if you have any doubts simply come check here!
To search for a specific wizard use the search box on the left sidebar.

.. todo::
    Finish wizards, not sure what to write here though.
