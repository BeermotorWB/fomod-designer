FOMOD Designer
==============

*A visual editor to quickly create FOMOD installers for Nexus based mods.*


Basic Usage
+++++++++++

For first-time users and those who don't really want to think too much about it.
Follow each wizard's instructions in the app to fully build an installer.
Remember than you can only save or open a new installer when on the very first page!
If you're mid-way through your work but you want to save and leave, simply hit ``Finish`` until you reach that first page.

Continue at :doc:`Basic Usage <basic>` for more information.


Advanced Usage
++++++++++++++

For the advanced users and everyone who knows their way around a FOMOD installer.
In this section you'll find descriptions of the tags and nodes themselves - what they are, how to use them and examples when needed.
There are no restrictions when using the ``Advanced View``, we trust that you know what you're doing.
This will offer you more customization options than the ``Basic View`` but it's also easier to get lost in big installers.
