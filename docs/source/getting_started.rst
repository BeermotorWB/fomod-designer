Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the *FOMOD Designer*! Let's get right to it.

Run the executable that comes with the package. If you need help with getting the correct package for you see
the :doc:`Installation <install>` page.

First, you'll see the **Intro** window. At the bottom of this window you'll see your most recently opened installers,
in the future you can select one here to open it more quickly. Since you most likely have no recent installers,
click the ``New/Open`` button. Here you'll choose the folder where the package you want to make an installer for
is located.

.. note::
    Now for an important distinction from other apps you may have used: the *FOMOD Designer* does not have separate
    **New** and **Open** buttons. Simply select the correct folder and it'll auto detect an existing installer.
    If you want to know about the behind the scenes for this, check the :ref:`F.A.Q. <open_new_merged>`.

The **Main** window should now appear. If you're a first-time user it should load the *Basic View* and you should head
on to the :doc:`Basic Usage <basic>`. In case you're a returning user and/or you've enabled the *Advanced View*
head to the :doc:`Advanced Usage <advanced>`.

.. attention::
    If you need help with a button or something else on the window, try hovering over it and checking the bottom left
    of the screen, in the status bar.
