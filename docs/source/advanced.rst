.. Describe advanced usage - advanced view and node tree

Welcome to the ``Advanced Usage`` section. This is recommended for people who already know how to create/modify XML
installers and are interested in speeding up their work or for users who want more customization options than the
``Basic View`` offers.

FOMOD For The Greater Good
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section contains the *FOMOD Bible* - a description of all the tags/nodes with examples. This is not meant to be read from top to bottom but rather as a dictionary or a glossary - search for the tag/node you need more info for with the search box on the left sidebar.

Tag vs Node
-----------

A **Tag** is any item within an xml document. Within the FOMOD schema (the document that defines the rules for installer documents)
all the allowed tags for FOMOD are defined. A tag has the format ``<thisisatag/>`` or ``<thisisatag>text goes here<thisisatag/>`` if it containes text.

Similarly, any item in the *FOMOD Designer*'s *Object Tree* is a **Node**. Every node has a direct correspondence to a xml tag. These two terms are use interchangeably in the *FOMOD Bible*.
